"This modern retelling of the classic fairytale follows a beautiful college freshman
as she pledges her late mother's once dignified sorority. But after discovering that
today's sisterhood is not what it used to be, Sydney finds her new home away from home
with seven outcasts. With the help of her new friends, Sydney will
take on the reigning campus queen to attempt to transform the school's misguided social hierarchy."

Sydney White is one of my favorite movies because the story line is very good.
Amanda Bynes, who plays Sydney White is an amazing actor and embodies her role really well.
This movie is very funny but, also has it's serious moments at times. Similary, to <b>Mean Girls </b>
this movie was realased in the 2000's. Alot, of movies relased in the 2000's focused on teen
drama, or th ghigh school experience. In addition, Amanda Bynes is a very good actor.
</s>Lastly, I like this movie because of its message and different themes.  </p>
