<b>RESPONSE:</b> Some reasons why I enjoy this movie is because of the humor. This movie
  is very funny and there are many memorable one liners, jokes, and
  scenes from this movie. For example, the phrase "on wednesdays we wear
  pink" is one of the most memorable and infamous quotes from this movie.
  Lastly, Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies because the acting is reaaly
  good. When you watch this movie it doesn't feel like the actors are playing a role.
  They embody and play their characters in the movie very well. </p> </div>
