<p><b>SYNOPSIS:</b>
"In the summer before starting high school, Julie (Alexa Vega) and
her best friends,Hannah (Mika Boorem), Yancy (Kallie Flynn Childress) and Farrah
have a slumber party. They use the night to shed their nerdy reputations, and
they end up in a scavenger hunt against a group of "popular" girls.
To win, Julie and her friends have to steal a car and a boy's underpants and sneak
into a nightclub, without Julie's mom (Jane Lynch) finding out."

<p><b>RESPONSE:</b>
Sleepover is one of my favorite movies because the plot is very good.
This movie was released in the year 2004. This movie is described as
a comedy/ romance teen movie. Alexa PenVega as the lead role and plays the
character Julie. This movie also has very simialr themes to the movie Sydney White,
and Mean Girls. Sleepover is a classic movie that icorporates humor and action.
I watched this movie for the first time when I was in elementary school and
loved it.</p> </div>
