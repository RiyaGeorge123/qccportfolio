   <h3> QCC Software Engineering Microcredential </h3><br>

<div class="pro">
 <p>
   While enrolled in the QCCâ€™s Software Engineering Micro-Credential I was able to<br>
   experience what it would feel like to have a career in Web Development.<br>
   The Boot Camp was a 100-hour online development environment over an intensive<br>
   five-week time frame. Over the five weeks I developed in-demand web development<br>
   skills, using programming languages like <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery and Python.<br></b>
   In addition, I learned about and used different tools and technologies to succeed<br>
   in front end and back end development, as well as full stack development. <br>
   Throughout, the program there was a mixture of individual work and group collaboration.<br><br>
 </p>




 <p>
   I gained several technical and soft skills while being apart of this program.<br>
   I plan on using what I learned while in this program to further enhance my <br>
   front- end developemnt and web design skills. Before, completing this program I <br>
   was always interested in back-end dvelopment for  software engineering.<br>
   However, after this program I have become <b>very interested in front-end development.</b> <br><br>
</p>



<p>
   Designing websites was fun and challenging. I learned alot about web design. <br>
   I really enjoyed web design because it allowed me to use my creative skills. <br>
   Web design has taught me that <b>creativitiy</b> is an important skill as any other <br>
   technical skill a person can aquire. You can code a webpage all day but, <br>
   if there is no creativitiy than your just left with what the code has produced. <br>
   However, having a webpage or an application that is interactive, user friendly,<br>
   and attractive makes a huge difference in the quality of a webpage.  <br><br>
